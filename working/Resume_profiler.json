  "Actionable_Suggestions": [
    "**Highlight Generative AI Expertise:**  Explicitly mention projects and experiences related to Generative AI models within the experience and projects sections. Quantify achievements whenever possible (e.g., 'Improved model accuracy by 15% using Generative AI techniques').",
    "**Showcase Python Proficiency:** Expand on the Python skills section by detailing specific libraries and frameworks used (e.g., 'Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)').  Mention any significant projects where Python played a crucial role.",
    "**Address Java Gap:** Since Java is a key requirement, consider adding a section dedicated to learning Java. Even brief mention of online courses or personal projects aiming to gain proficiency in Java can be impressive.",
    "**Emphasize Data Handling Skills:** The resume lacks explicit mention of data engineering skills.  Rephrase project descriptions to highlight data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training aspects.  Mention any experience with data pipelines even if not explicitly named as such (e.g., 'Developed and maintained data pipelines for efficient model training').",
    "**Integrate Relevant Keywords:** Incorporate the missing keywords naturally within the resume, ensuring they are not just added but truly reflect the candidate's abilities and experience.  For example, mention familiarity with cloud platforms even if experience is limited to exploring or using free tiers.",
    "**Quantify Achievements:** Add quantifiable results to project descriptions (e.g., 'Reduced processing time by 20% using Apache Kafka'). This demonstrates impact and strengthens the resume.",
    "**Expand Project Descriptions:** The project descriptions are concise. Expand them to highlight the technical skills used and the challenges overcome.  For instance, detail the specific type of Convolutional Neural Network used in the ASL Detection project.  Mention the specific time series forecasting methods employed in the Waste Management System.",
    "**Tailor to the Job Description:** Reorganize the resume to directly address the key responsibilities outlined in the job description. The resume should flow logically from the required skills to the candidate's achievements."
