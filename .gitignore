# --- Python Specific ---

# Ignore all virtual environments, no matter where they are.
# This is a safety net in case someone creates one anyway.

# Ignore Python cache files
**/__pycache__/

# =================================================================
# --- Application Specific (Secrets & Temporary Files) ---

# Ignore ALL .env files anywhere in the project. CRITICAL for security.
**/.env
**/.env.*



# Ignore any log, json, or md files that might be accidentally
# created in the root of the backend or frontend directories.
# This prevents clutter from test runs.
# IMPORTANT: If your frontend uses a README.md you want to keep,
# you might make this more specific, e.g., "backend/*.md"
# For now, this is a safe default.
*.log



# =================================================================
# --- Docker & Build Artifacts ---

# Ignore Docker build context archives
