  "Actionable_Suggestions": [
    "Quantify accomplishments in each role.  Instead of 'Led a team of interns...', try 'Led a team of 5 interns, resulting in a 15% improvement in LLM performance.'  Use metrics whenever possible.",
    "Highlight experience with specific LLM platforms (OpenAI, etc.). If experience exists with similar platforms, rephrase to emphasize those similarities.  For instance, if experience with a different cloud platform is present, emphasize transferable skills: \"Experienced in deploying models on [Cloud Platform X]; readily adaptable to AWS, Azure, or GCP.\"",
    "Showcase proficiency in 'embeddings' and 'model orchestration' by adding details to project descriptions, emphasizing the processes involved in your projects. For example: \"Utilized word embeddings to improve semantic search capabilities within the RAG architecture.\" or \"Orchestrated multiple models using [Specific method] to achieve efficient workflow.\"",
    "Add a dedicated section on 'MLOps' if applicable, explaining any involvement in model deployment, monitoring, or maintenance, even if it was a small part of previous projects.  Example: \"Contributed to the CI/CD pipeline for LLM deployment, improving deployment speed by 10%.\"",
    "Explicitly mention any experience with frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, etc., even if indirectly relevant.  If you used similar frameworks, highlight the transferable skills and the parallels. Example: \"Developed custom agent frameworks similar in concept to LangGraph, enabling efficient multi-agent communication.\"",
    "Incorporate keywords from the 'missing_keywords' list into project descriptions and skills section where appropriate, even if it requires rewording to highlight similar skills or experiences.  Focus on transferable skills.",
    "Add a section detailing experience with 'synthetic datasets', even if it involved creating a smaller subset of data or similar tasks, if this is possible given your experience.",
    "Revise the resume to include relevant details in project descriptions. For example, 'Used Python and LLMs to create a chatbot that improved customer satisfaction by 15%.'",
    "If you have experience with any of the listed tools like 'Microsoft Copilot Studio', 'DevRev', etc., even if limited, include them in your skills section.",
    "Highlight experience with evaluating models, even if the methods were not exactly the same as specified.   Example: \"Developed and utilized custom metrics to assess LLM performance, focusing on factors like accuracy, latency, and hallucination rates.\""
