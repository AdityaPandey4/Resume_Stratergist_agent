      "description": "Led a team of interns in developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) applications. Worked on training and testing LLMs to optimize performance for real-world applications. Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enhance contextual relevance. Applied prompt engineering techniques to minimize hallucinations and ensure stable outputs. Built a Streamlit-based frontend to enable seamless interaction with the deployed models. Led a team of interns in developing and fine-tuning image generation models using Stable Diffusion and GANs. Collected, cleaned, and prepared datasets to improve model training efficiency and output quality. Applied"
